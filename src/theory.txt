    //you have div or react fragment ot wrap all your JSx code
    <>
      <MyName/>{/*NESTED COMPONENT(function)*/}
      
      <h1 className="myclass1">Welcome I am Shrishti Jain {9+9}</h1>
      
    </>
    //<p>Give error </p> to resolve wrap it inside parent tag i.e,div/section /react.fragment(best) syntax of react fragment-->  <>.....</>
  )
}
const MyName=()=>{
  return(
    <h1>HII EVERYONE</h1>
